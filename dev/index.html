        <p class="first">MediaWorks is looking for a software developer to create software that enables ministries to share media with each other in a decentralised way and quickly create interactive community websites and webapps.</p>
        <p>We are looking for a Software developer to strengthen our experienced development team. You will be working in a team sharing the vision to create software that enables ministries to thrive digitally and share God's love with the least reached in new ways.</p>


        <p class="short-about">LightNet is an online product that enables ministries to run their own media distribution platforms. This digital tool helps ministries to publish curated content in the language and context of their focus communities. </p>

          <h3>Technologies</h3>
          <p>We are using the following stack:</p>
          <ul><li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Progressive web apps (PWA)</li>
          <li>Resource Description Framework (RDF) database</li>
          <li>Docker, Linux</li>
          <li>Continuous integration and delivery pipeline</li>
          <li>Automated testing tools</li>
          <li>Cloud Infrastructure and Infrastructure as Code tools </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What you would be working on</h3>
          <p>We are building a highly decentralised system that has a couple of components. Depending on your interests and skills, you can work with the primary focus on the frontend, backend or infrastructure aspect. We are not only building a content management system (CMS) but also a generic frontend that is highly configurable by the ministries using it. For example: <a target="_blank" href="https://library.mediaworks.global/en">library.mediaworks.global</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://nadija.org/uk">nadija.org</a>.</p>
            <p>Some ministries will need a fully customised frontend. We are building the system in an agile way and will adapt our focus and direction depending on the use cases of the local ministries.</p>

          <ul>
          <li>Understanding of and compliance with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.om.org/mediaworks/en/content/about-om">OM core values and statement of faith</a></li>
          <li>A few years of work experience in the industry </li>
          <li>Familiarity with some of the above-mentioned technologies </li>
          <li>Interest in Open Source and decentralisation</li>
